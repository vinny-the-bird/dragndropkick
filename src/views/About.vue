            <p> First of all, thank you for visiting this page! If you landed on this URL, it's probably not by any random way I guess, so yeah: big THANKS!</p><br>

            <p>This website is my first one. It will serve as my personal sandbox and testing/training ground. Hopefully, I will also be able to share fun / silly / maybe useful(?) little things here. If people can enjoy stuff out from that chaotic workshop of mine, even for 10 seconds, that would be a win for me haha.</p>
            <p>See you around!</p>
